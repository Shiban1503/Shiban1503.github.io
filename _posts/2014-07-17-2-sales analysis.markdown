project-name: Exploratory Data Analysis of Retail Store Using LSTM
link: https://github.com/Shiban1503/Retail-Sales-EDA-Forecasting-using-LSTM
Description: This project utilizes machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast weekly sales and provide actionable insights. By integrating historical sales data, store performance metrics, and macroeconomic factors such as fuel prices, temperature, and holidays, the system provides a comprehensive analysis. It includes a data preprocessing pipeline and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure high data quality and identify hidden trends. Key achievements include improving sales prediction accuracy by 15% and generating insights that optimize inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing decisions across 50+ retail stores.
