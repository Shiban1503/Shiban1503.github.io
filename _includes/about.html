          Hi there! I'm Mohamed Shiban Lal, a passionate and driven Data Analyst with a knack for turning raw data into actionable insights. Currently pursuing my MSc in Data Science, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and technical expertise to the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a strong foundation in tools like Excel, SQL, and Python, I have worked on various projects ranging from predictive modeling to data visualization. My goal is to uncover stories hidden in data and translate them into strategies that drive meaningful results.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive in collaborative environments where I can use my skills to solve real-world problems. Whether it’s creating insightful dashboards, developing machine learning models, or analyzing complex datasets, I’m always up for a challenge.
