          As a recent MSc Data Science and Analytics graduate from the University of Westminster, I combine strong analytical skills with practical experience in machine learning and data visualization. My academic journey, complemented by over 3 years of experience at EY, has equipped me with a unique blend of technical expertise and business acumen.

          I'm passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights. My recent projects include developing LSTM neural networks for retail sales forecasting and implementing deep reinforcement learning for investment strategies. I'm now seeking opportunities to apply my skills in data analytics, where I can contribute to data-driven decision-making and business growth.
