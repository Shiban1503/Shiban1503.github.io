        <p>
          I’m an MSc Data Science graduate with a strong foundation in analytics, machine learning, and business insight. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI, I specialize in building predictive models, crafting intuitive dashboards, and translating complex datasets into strategic actions.
          Whether it’s improving customer retention, forecasting trends, or simplifying stakeholder decisions, I bring curiosity, precision, and purpose to every project. I believe in the power of data not just to inform, but to inspire action.
